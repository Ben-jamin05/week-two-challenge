# Week Two Challenge

## Description

My motivation for this project was to make myself a website to display my portfolio. This consists of writing an about me section, a place to display and link my work, a place to link my resume, and a place to link my contact information. I accomplished this with my html and css skills that I have learned so far and I learned more about styling during this project. 

## Installation

You can either just go to the website from the Github repository or via this [link](https://ben-jamin05.github.io/week-two-challenge/) or clone the code from the repository. 

## Usage

Once you have navigated to the website it should look something like [This](./assets/images/Screenshot%202024-04-11%20at%204.03.52â€¯PM.png). You will find four options at the top. These are the site naviagtion links and will bring you to the 'About Me', 'Work', 'Contact Me', and 'Resume' sections. In the work section you can find links to my work by clicking on their images. In the resume section you can click on the link to be taken to my resume. In the contact section you can click on my email to email me or on GitHub to be taken to my GitHub.
